## What Is It?
PyLaunch Is A Program Generated By [ChatGPT By OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/), And Improved By Me, __Prattay Sarkar__!\

**New GUI Improvements have Been Added**, So It Looks **Nice**!
## How Do I Use It?
It's ***Easy*** As **Heck** To Use!\
__But,__ If You Are A __Dumb Lil *Kid*__, Here's How To Use It:
+ Open Up The Program __(Well, Duh!)__
+ Use The `Add` Button To __Add__ An Application **(Or Any Other _File_!)**
+ Use The `Remove` Button To __Remove__ An Application!
+ Use The `Launch` Button To __Launch__ An Application **(Or Any Other _File_!)**
## It It Useful?
Probally Nah, But It **Might** For **Someone**!
## How To Compile It From Source Code?
Here's How To __Do__ It:
+ Download The Git Repo
+ Make Sure You Have `Pip` Installed
+ PyInstaller can package a Python script and all its dependencies into a single executable file that can be run on another machine without requiring Python to be installed.
+ To use PyInstaller, you can first install it using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `pip install pyinstaller`
+ Once PyInstaller is installed, you can navigate to the directory containing your Python script and run the following command to create a standalone executable: `pyinstaller your_script.py`
+ This will create a new directory called dist in your current directory, containing your_script.exe (on Windows) or your_script (on Linux/MacOS), which is the standalone executable that you can distribute to others.
> Note that PyInstaller may have some limitations and dependencies may not work as expected!
